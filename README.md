# water_wave
this is an animation to simulate water wave using es6 which interactive when you click on the web page.

To be honest, water wave is much complexed than transverse wave, and transverse wave can not spread in water. However, hydrone which in water surface have both vertical movement and Horizontal movement(hardly to see).

So I use a transverse wave propagation which along the +x axis to simulate water wave.
